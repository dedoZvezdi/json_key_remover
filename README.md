## FAQ ❓

 **Q:** Is the original file overwritten?  
  **A:** No, the output file is saved separately. You specify its location and filename.

  **A:** The app automatically cleans such characters before processing.

 **Q:** Can I use this on nested JSON structures?  
  **A:** Yes, keys are collected recursively and can be filtered regardless of depth.
